# [NATO Architecture Framework](http://nafdocs.github.io)


This repository contains a partial Jekyll port of the NAF
documentation site (nafdocs.org). The purpose of porting the site from
Wordpress to Jekyll is to ensure, we are able to preserve the
documentation for the future and to increase the engagement of all the
stakeholders.

Contributors should use the features of Github such as pull requests and issues.
